# Caesar Cipher Project

#### Description:
This project is a Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, the letter 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. This is a great way to learn the basics of encryption algorithms and how text manipulation works in programming.

### Features:
- **Encryption**: The program encrypts a given plaintext message using the Caesar Cipher with a user-specified shift value. This allows users to transform readable text into an encoded form, making it suitable for basic encryption use cases.

- **Decryption**: The program can also decrypt an encoded message, either by asking the user to provide the shift value or by using a brute force method. The brute force method tries all 25 possible shift values and outputs the results, allowing the user to easily determine the correct decryption.

- **Brute Force Decryption**: In addition to a direct decryption approach, the program offers the ability to perform a brute force attack on an encrypted message. This means the program will automatically try all possible shifts and display the results for the user to manually inspect.

- **User Input Handling**: The program prompts the user for the desired action (encryption or decryption), checks for valid inputs, and allows for continuous interaction by confirming if the user wants to proceed with brute-forcing decryption or entering a shift value.

- **Edge Cases Handled**: The program ensures that non-alphabetic characters such as numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks are not altered during encryption or decryption. This preserves the structure of the original message while encrypting only the alphabetic characters.

- **Shift Normalization**: When encrypting or decrypting, the program normalizes the shift value to ensure it is within the range of 0-25, preventing unexpected behavior if a user enters an extremely large or negative shift value.

### Technical Details:
- The program is implemented using Python, with helper functions for handling the shifting of individual letters based on whether they are uppercase or lowercase.
- It uses a generator for the brute force decryption function, allowing users to iterate through possible shifts and see the corresponding results one by one.
- The code is designed with modularity in mind, with functions for encryption, decryption, shifting uppercase and lowercase letters, and brute-forcing the cipher.

### Design Considerations:
- **Modularity**: Functions are kept small and focused (single-responsibility) to improve readability and reusability. This makes testing and debugging easier.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to run in a terminal with clear prompts, validations, and instructions to accommodate users with varying experience levels.
- **Shift Behavior**: Shift values greater than 25 are normalized to stay within bounds of the alphabet, allowing for greater flexibility in input.
- **Non-Alphabetic Characters**: Characters like digits and punctuation are left unchanged to preserve the original message structure and formatting.
- **Brute Force Usability**: Includes an interactive prompt between each possible decryption, letting users manually inspect and decide when to stop.
- **Testing and Type Checking**: All critical functions are covered by `pytest` test cases, and the code has been statically analyzed with `mypy` to catch any type-related issues early.
- **Code Formatting**: All files are formatted with `black` to ensure consistency and readability across the project.

### Dependencies:
- **black**: Used for code formatting to ensure consistent code style across the project.
- **pytest**: A testing framework used to verify the correctness of the Caesar Cipher implementation, including the encryption and decryption functions, as well as the brute force mechanism.
- **mypy**: A type checker for Python, helping to catch potential type errors in the code and ensuring the program runs as expected with type safety.

### How to Use:
1. Run the program by executing the Python script. You will be prompted to either encrypt or decrypt a message.
2. If encrypting, input the plaintext message and the shift value.
3. If decrypting, input the ciphertext and either provide a shift value or opt for brute-forcing.
4. The program will output the result, whether it is an encrypted or decrypted message.

### Example Use Case:
1. **Encrypting a message**:
   - Input message: "Hello, World!"
   - Shift value: 3
   - Output: "Khoor, Zruog!"

2. **Decrypting a message**:
   - Input ciphertext: "Khoor, Zruog!"
   - Shift value: 3
   - Output: "Hello, World!"

3. **Brute-forcing a message**:
   - Input ciphertext: "Khoor, Zruog!"
   - Brute force tries all shifts from 1 to 25 and outputs the results, helping you manually identify the correct shift.

### Conclusion:
This Caesar Cipher project not only demonstrates a classic encryption algorithm but also reflects key software engineering principles such as modular design, input validation, and code testing. Itâ€™s ideal for learners interested in cryptography, text processing, or getting hands-on experience with Python programming. By engaging with this project, users gain practical exposure to secure message encoding and decoding, while also learning to write clean, maintainable code.
